# BankAccount
A java code that imitates the functions of an advanced ATM with multiple accounts and allowing them to manipulate multiple accounts that are tied to their social security number. The code catches all errors with custom catch 's and errors.

The application can be ran one of two ways. Either do it full autonomous or manual input values to have it run through the test cases. You can use the pre written test case fill labled choices to do it autonomoulsy or change it to system in to read from keyboard.
